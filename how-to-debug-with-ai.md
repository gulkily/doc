# How to Debug with AI

## Effective AI-Assisted Debugging Techniques

### 1. Rubber Duck Method with AI
Ask your AI assistant: "Please explain this issue in detail using the rubber duck method"

This approach helps you:
- Articulate the problem clearly
- Walk through the code step by step
- Identify assumptions and potential issues
- Get a fresh perspective on the logic flow

### 2. Add Comprehensive Debug Output
Ask your AI assistant to add detailed debug info output throughout the problematic code

Benefits include:
- Visibility into variable states at key points
- Understanding of execution flow
- Identification of where the code diverges from expected behavior
- Real-time insight into data transformations

### 3. Generate Detailed Debug Reports
Ask your AI assistant to write a detailed report on the issue as an MD or TXT file and then use it for iterating on the debug process

This creates:
- A structured analysis of the problem
- Documentation of findings and hypotheses
- A reference for tracking debugging progress
- A foundation for collaborative debugging sessions
